## Overview

**Recipe Sharing App** 
Recipe Sharing App is a simple and interactive web app that lets users view, and use recipes in an easy-to-use interface. The project was built to practice front-end development skills while creating something useful and fun.

Users can use the recipe titles and descriptions to prepare whatever they want, and thanks to localStorage, the recipes stay saved even after refreshing the page. The app focuses on clean design, usability, and scalability for future features like search, filtering, and recipe categories.

The project was built to practice and showcase front-end development skills using modern tools and libraries. Recipes search history are stored in the browser‚Äôs **localStorage**, so they persist even after refreshing the page.  

This app focuses on:
- ü•ó Simple recipe creation (title + description)
- üíæ Data persistence using `localStorage`
- ‚öõÔ∏è A modular React component structure for scalability
- üé® A responsive and user-friendly design  

The goal of this project is not only to make recipes viewing fun and easy, but also to demonstrate the power of **React** for building dynamic, real-world web applications.
